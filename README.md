# Music app - Hackathon

App that displays trending music at the moment, always updated and it needs to be blazingly fast

Move quickly and test that speed out! (You can use the keyboard for the songs)

PD: I like how it looks with fullscreen and on phone!

You can listen a preview of each song clicking on it and you can use the Youtube Music button to go to the full song
